"<p class=""media-deck""> The Special Edition corrects a number of flaws and adds several new features but somehow ends up being only a tiny bit more appealing than its predecessor.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> This is a great deal for those who've never played the games.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> British Open Championship Golf is a unique entry into the world of golf sims that is sadly brought down by a few flaws.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The Enhanced Campaign CD is a good package, but more is needed to bring JF3 up to speed.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Capitalism Plus is an overall improvement to the original system, not a complete rewrite.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Overall, International Superstar Soccer 64 offers just about everything FIFA 64 did. It just does it slightly better.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> NHL Open Ice bears about as much resemblance to real hockey as tee ball does to baseball.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Despite its flaws, WCW Mayhem still manages to be a fun, original game, and it is definitely worth picking up.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> The game's well-designed levels and novel game types make it a fun alternative to its more visceral inspirations.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> You'll realize right away that the ideal setting for intense music creation is not the 2MB RAM PlayStation.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The collection is a relatively low-frills compilation, but the quality of the games more than makes up for a deficiency in the history department.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While Vandal Hearts II lacks the grand feel of Final Fantasy Tactics, it is a solid and rewarding strategy-RPG.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Keep in mind that if this review were based on time spent with the standard Dreamcast controller alone, the score would go down by at least three full points. If ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's very easy to dismiss it as ""yet another weird Japanese music game,"" but in some ways, it comes across as a work of art, designed in an extremely deliberate ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Dark Arms is a neat little RPG with gothic overtones.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The game tries hard to play like Real Bout 2, and it pulls it off pretty well.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> NBA Jam 99 on the Game Boy Color takes the series back to the two-on-two arcade action that it is famous for.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It is, however, exactly what most puzzle fans are looking for: a fun, value-packed addictive experience that looks as good as perhaps a puzzle game can or should.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Valkyrie Profile is a complex, ambitious, and gorgeous title that offers much to like: beautiful aesthetics, an entertaining battle system, engaging characters, and a creatively balanced ""dual"" scenario.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While this title isn't going to win any awards, it's a satisfying way to spend some free time.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Musically, Stepping Selection eschews Konami's techno-laced offering in favor of two CDs full of pop music.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> It's an alternative for gamers more interested in down-and-dirty stock-car action than in perfect realism.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The game's most notable and impressive feature is the slick, hand-painted artwork that gives Shadow Watch the look and style of a graphic novel.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> The action is still there, and, even more surprisingly, so are many of the frills that make the experience feel genuine.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> BCT Commander in many ways delivers exactly what it claims to--it's a rigorous, realistic simulation of what it's like to command a brigade of combined-arms troops in modern warfare.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Despite a solid combat system and a good presentation, this latest Castlevania is cursed with extremely monotonous levels that prevent it from being an engaging action-adventure game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> All of the problems that plagued the PlayStation 2 version of the original Brothers in Arms are front and center once again, making for a lackluster port of a great ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's got some of the console and PC versions' mechanics, but the lack of a story-based campaign and online multiplayer sucks much of the fun out of this PSP shooter.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Path of Neo is a good brawler at its core, but the PC version is seriously lacking in comparison to its console counterparts.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's functional backgammon on your 360, and not much else. But if you're into the game, that's probably good enough.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Marble Blast Ultra offers a decent challenge, but boring multiplayer and a lack of variety drag it down a bit.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Jewel Quest sticks a little too close to the Bejeweled formula for its own good, but it does require you to master a different set of strategies.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Metal Smash Pinball plays well, but there isn't enough to it to keep you entertained for very long.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The apathetic presentation and a slew of gameplay bugs make it hard to enjoy Major League Baseball 2K6, which is otherwise a deep and feature-rich baseball simulation.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> World Poker Tour for the PSP retains many of the console versions' strengths and weaknesses, though it tosses in a few more weaknesses of its own.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Dr. Sudoku has a decent set of features and a lot of prebuilt puzzles, but a D pad and buttons isn't the ideal way to play.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The Legend of Heroes II does little to set itself apart from the previous game, or most other Japanese role-playing games, for that matter.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Blade Dancer plays by the book as far as the narrative goes, but an interesting crafting mechanic and an adaptive battle system with real-time elements help set it apart.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> The Life is a flawed, yet fun basketball game that's worth a look for anyone that's searching for a different take on the sport.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The unfaltering polygonal consistency of King's Field is mesmerizing after extended play.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Those who loved the arcade game version of Samurai Shodown III will be happy with this conversion.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> JetFighter III is a good game, if not a great sim, and that's good enough.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Prospective buyers will definitely want to rent this one first to see if they can stomach its inadequacies.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This game is strictly about verbiage and the various ways you can contort it. And, for the most part, it works.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Unless you're the proud owner of the Three's Company box set, this game will likely get old quick.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Roberta Williams did not invent the adventure game genre, but she has aided in its evolution time and time again.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Final Fantasy IV looks most dated by today's standards.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Proves that the PC is indeed a viable platform for fighting games.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> If all you're looking for in a baseball sim are handsome graphics and a good interface when playing in action mode, VR Baseball gives you everything you want.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Battlespire's less expansive scope, hack-and-slash gameplay, and technical problems ultimately provide a role-playing experience that is only occasionally satisfying.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> East Front remains a paradox. Parts of it are exceptionally well done whileother parts tend to cancel out its positive aspects.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Mischief Makers is a good game that will leave players wanting more.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Mystical Ninja is a solid, quirky, and entirely rehashed title that holds its own well against the horde of painful Mario clones.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Bomberman Hero once again places our bombastic buddy in the role of platform protagonist.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> For all Iggy's trademark puzzle-game annoyances, it also has the perks.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This hack-and-slash action/role-playing game is pleasant, but it just doesn't live up to its ambition and ends up feeling small and empty.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Good looks and a fast pace don't add up to top-shelf gameplay, and Redline Racer falls a bit flat where it could have easily excelled.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Jackie Chan's Stuntmaster is a solid game, but from a technological standpoint, it's a bit behind the pack.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Final Fantasy VIII for the PC is a completely inadequate conversion of the attractive yet problematic console role-playing game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Overall, it's a great version of a real classic.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you're looking for a high-quality action game, you can't go wrong with this one.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Last Call is a fast-paced, entertaining, and humorous game for adults that can teach the casual player some fun drink recipes.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Test Drive Le Mans should be more than enough to keep arcade-racing fans happy for a while at least.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While Gunship! is nominally a flight simulator, it's really a flight action game.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> WCW Mayhem marks a respectable entry for EA into the realm of handheld wrestling titles.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> BreakNeck's impressive selection of cars and tracks add value to what would otherwise be a straightforward racing game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's an extremely ambitious simulation that provides plenty of original gameplay but fails to adequately refine its presentation.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's apparent that no real effort was made to push the game past other F1 racing simulators.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you're a pinball fan, Fantastic Journey is a pretty amazing feat, and the price is definitely right.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While it has some interesting sequences, and can be really enjoyable at times, more often F.A.K.K. 2 merely seems like the framework for a much better game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Tyco RC stacks up well against the competition, but doesn't add any major innovations to the formula established by RC Revenge.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The simplistic melee combat system combined with weak enemy artificial intelligence makes Rune an ultimately shallow and repetitious experience.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> 989 has opted to take the easy road this time around, and the result is a basketball game that remains virtually unchanged from last year's version.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Though the game is in many ways flawed, Orphen: Scion of Sorcery's interesting core game system often manages to transcend the game's poor production and haphazard design.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Though Blair Witch Volume 2 is not particularly scary, it has a fairly interesting story that's paced briskly.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> TWINE is not GoldenEye for the PlayStation, but if you're tired of playing through Medal of Honor or Metal Gear Solid, it provides temporary relief for your stealth shooting addiction.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> IMPORT: Thanks the grassroots presentation, a relatively creative style of narrative, and an affordable price, El Dorado Gate Chapter 1 is a promising title.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Star Wars Demolition might seem like some half-baked attempt to cash in on the Star Wars license, though it's actually a competently executed game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Ready 2 Rumble: Round 2 is a fun game that will undoubtedly impress those who've never played the original.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The game's incomplete interface, uneven pacing, and typical units all serve to make it less interesting than it might have been.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Younger children will be delighted to be at the controls, but seasoned gamers will want to look elsewhere for a more polished and challenging experience.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Although the graphics and sound that represent them are unlikely to impress anyone, the games themselves are every bit as enjoyable as many of them have been for centuries.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> F1 Championship Season 2000 is about what you'd expect: An arcade-style racing game with a simulation twist that's amply capable of satisfying the F1 fan's pocket-gaming needs.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> ATV Offroad Fury delivers a game that adheres to a more arcade style of gameplay, with a definite focus on fast, simplified gameplay mechanics and big, big air.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The Bouncer makes a great showpiece for the PlayStation 2.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Air Attack 2 is a major disappointment, not because it is an exceptionally bad game, but because it had the potential to be an exceptionally great game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Majestic is a very passive experience, and as the novelty fades, so will your interest.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Enemy-packed level design contributes to a single-player experience that is significantly harder on the normal difficulty level than the notoriously challenging Myth and Myth II single-player campaigns.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> An extended period of time spent with Madden NFL 2002 will likely prove unfulfilling to all but the most forgiving arcade sports gamers.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Your enjoyment of Portal Runner depends wholly on your tolerance for both straight-up, albeit slightly watered-down, 3D platform-adventure gameplay.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Thanks to its dichotomous design, fans of the vert event will love X Games Skateboarding, while street fans should look elsewhere.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While it may not be the world champion of team-oriented multiplayer games, Clusterball is an unusual and enjoyable addition to the genre.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Hockey fans might want to pick up NHL Hitz 2002 if they're looking for something different, but for everyone else, a weekend rental should suffice.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> There are other, more-engaging multiplayer experiences to be had with the Xbox, but at this point, none have the pick-up-and-play appeal of Fuzion Frenzy.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While Amped: Freestyle Snowboarding is visually impressive and loaded with options, its technical merits are drastically undermined by its shoddy gameplay.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> You might be better off playing games that are geared towards delivering one solid type of game, rather than taking four beaten paths.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Secret Service has a lot of potential that's hampered by sloppy execution.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you feel like playing through a solid arcade shooter set in the Star Wars universe, then you might want to give Starfighter a try.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> For the most part, it makes good on the PlayStation 2 version, but it's dragged down by somewhat problematic graphics.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While it's almost identical to the PlayStation 2 version, the GameCube version is made slightly less desirable by the choppy, somewhat pixilated graphics.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Its uniqueness has allowed Ultima Online to boast an unprecedented record for commercial longevity, but the game is finally running out of steam.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> World of Outlaws: Sprint Cars 2002 is clearly a game that will appeal to fans of the real-life motorsport.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's a surprisingly competent port. Unfortunately, it's a port of a game that most fans consider to be completely obsolete.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Though Prince of Qin is an epic adventure in the vein of Baldur's Gate, an awkward English translation and some lackluster production values prevent it from having the same appeal.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The game certainly isn't for everyone, but if you give it a chance, it can offer many rewards.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's a faithful and occasionally challenging adaptation of the game show, though it's doubtful that many players will get excited about winning imaginary money and prizes.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Though Project Nomads draws inspiration from some truly unique games, the game itself ends up being a fairly generic shooter.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Platoon isn't a bad game by any means, but it could have been much, much better.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> For now, The Sims Online lacks many of the options that made the original game so intriguing, and doesn't really replace them.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you can live with Test Drive's shortcomings and you relish the thought of ridiculous high speeds and occasional collisions, you might want to give it a try.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Post Mortem doesn't put enough emphasis on its own interesting features, and the rest of the time, it's just another formulaic adventure.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Master of Orion III is a disappointing follow-up to the two most significant space empire games ever.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Baseball Mogul 2004 is at least a marginal improvement over its predecessor.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Even though it packs in a lot of value, if you weren't particularly enchanted by Heroes IV, Winds of War probably won't change your mind.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Even devout fans of the sport would be better off with the previous Tapout game, or, if they own a PlayStation 2, THQ's Pride FC.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Overall, this game warrants a solid score for its many attributes - decent artificial intelligence (especially the goalies), nice animation, entertaining play modes, and multiplayer. But unfortunately the automatic player-switching ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> With so much competition on the PS it's tough to recommend Striker Pro 2000 over FIFA or ISS.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> New or younger players should be able to look past the game's limitations and simply accept it as a simple but fun game.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> While the game is aimed at a younger crowd, it still manages to be good, albeit short-term, fun.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> The King of Fighters '99 for the PlayStation is a fairly good port in and of itself, especially considering the limitations of the aging PlayStation hardware.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> A cute story mode isn't enough to compensate for Trioncube's unoriginal and incredibly easy take on the Tetris formula.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> A new Blitzkrieg game in everything but its title, Frontline: Fields of Thunder is yet another cookie-cutter WWII RTS.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Shining Force Exa is fun for the first few hours, but it quickly wears out its welcome with dull combat and a frame rate that struggles to keep up with ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Galaga for the Virtual Console is a perfect emulation of an imperfect port--the clunky NES version doesn't do Namco's shooter the justice it deserves.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Innocent Life is a watered-down Harvest Moon game without the series' trademark depth and charm.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Rampage World Tour is a bare-bones port of the arcade original, which means it's shallow but fun when played with friends for a short while.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Aside from the pretty backgrounds and rocking soundtrack, Dead Moon doesn't have much to offer over most other shooters available for the Virtual Console.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Overall, Star Rangers lacks the detail and depth that make an engaging spacecombat simulator.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Iron Man has needed a video game for a long time (after all, he was the first high-tech superhero). This game couldn't miss. Or could it?</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> If Microsoft and Pajitnov want to make us forget about Tetris, they're going to have to do a lot better than this.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Much of War Inc.'s potential goes unfulfilled because the real-time combat doesn't measure up.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This sequel falls squarely into the rent-me bin.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While Bomberman World isn't a particularly bad game per se, it's clearly not the best representative of what the series has to offer.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Aesthetically, Star Trek Pinball contains a rather uninspired suite of flashing lights, shooting cues, and sound effects.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Every so often a title comes along that, for whatever reason, you really want to like.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Argonaut's Buck Bumble has the look and feel of a first generation Nintendo 64 game that missed its boat.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> A more full-featured, technically competitive version of Golden Tee Golf could earn a place alongside the best of the field.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> H.E.D.Z.'s inspired design doesn't always translate into inspiring gameplay, and while it's frequently funny, it's not very fun once the novelty wears off.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> You listen to a command, then click the appropriate button. Repeat this about 200 times, and you've got an idea of how thrilling things can get.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Its uninspired arcade-style biking action doesn't come close to doing justice to the big-name license.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> With a different fighting engine behind it, this could have been a much, much better game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Scrabble on the PlayStation appears to be exactly what you expect from Scrabble at your mom's house - minus the little wooden letters that look like bouillon cubes.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While Time Stalkers' story is passable enough, its contradictory dungeon, battle, and experience system undermines any hope you may have had of enjoying this game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> TD6's mock-serious approach to arcade-style racing should warrant nothing more than a rental.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Mission: Impossible seems geared to those hard-core gamers out there who have both the time and the patience to spend replaying level after level until they've finished the game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The Runabout series not only hasn't kept up with the times (Crazy Taxi is this type of game almost fully realized), it's lost a lot of what made it so ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Evergrace is just shy of average - there's nothing particularly bad here, but what little good it has is purely incidental and generally ignorable.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Although Bomberman 64: The Second Attack is not at all revolutionary, it is not especially well executed in any particular area, and it suffers noticeably in the graphics and sound ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> In the end, when you take all of Omikron's various parts and add them together, the game doesn't amount to much.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> In the end, Action Bass is a solid arcade-style fishing game that the majority of armchair anglers will enjoy.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The game's slow pacing, simple combat, weak production values, and other shortcomings collectively prevent it from being much fun.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Essentials is a stand-alone Rainbow Six product that's half Rogue Spear mission pack and half civil service test simulator.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Even if you like the basic premise and action of the game, a number of very serious flaws quickly sap its entertainment value.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While those who are fans of the film might find some redeeming quality in Chicken Run, most should definitely avoid it.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> NASCAR Heat isn't quite the all-encompassing racing simulation that Electronic Arts' NASCAR 2001 is, but features like the beat the heat mode make the game worthwhile for any NASCAR fan.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The fatal flaw in Unison is the unforgivably shallow gameplay.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While it may appeal to nostalgic Starcraft fans, there isn't anything in Outlive that isn't done much better in any number of recent games.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While the gameplay is on par with the original versions of the games, the original versions managed to look and sound a bit better than Midway's N64 renditions.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While die-hard strategy fans and extreme fans of the Heroes series on the PC might get a kick out of this one, it's really a rental at best.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The core gameplay in Merchant Prince II holds up surprisingly well, despite the passage of almost six years, which in computer game terms is the equivalent of several geologic eras.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Floigan Brothers has a distinct look and a clever concept, but these are its only strengths, and they aren't enough to support the rest of the game's numerous flaws.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> ESPN International Winter Sports is a collection of 10 minigames that can be played solo or head-to-head--and little else.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The combat is simply not very engaging, and since the combat is all there is, that's a real problem.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> These remakes don't look that great or play that well, but at least you get all three of them for $20.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Tetris Worlds offers several solid interpretations of the classic Russian mindbender, though there's little here that hasn't been seen before.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Though it features superdeformed versions of some of Namco's more recognizable characters, Pac-Man Fever is basically just another shallow party game.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> When you're playing an action game, the last thing you want to do is to stand around regaining stamina while there are still aliens left to fight.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you're a fan of futuristic racers, there's probably nothing in Drome Racers to enjoy that you haven't already seen in a better game.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Casino Inc. ends up being a game that's more complicated, and less fun, than it probably should have been.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The Xbox version of Soldier of Fortune II has too many problems to be recommended as anything other than a brief rental.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Jack the Ripper turns the usual gaming trend on its head: The developers spent a lot of time creating an engaging story but hardly put any gameplay into the game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The only remarkable thing about Samurai Jack is how utterly unremarkable it is, and that's certainly not a good reason to play this game.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Shrek 2 plays more like a quickie advertisement for the film than a stand-alone mobile title.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Spidey's mobile adventure is uneventful and repetitive, leaving its decent graphics and simple but reliable control as its only positive features.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The bottom line is that Crazy Castle just isn't much fun. Those looking to avoid tedious gameplay should leave this damsel in distress.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While portions of the game show promise, Spider-Man 2's jerky gameplay and occasional crash bugs overshadow these promising points.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Ping Pong POW tries to add a new wrinkle to a video game classic. Unfortunately, by doing so it drains much of the fun from ping pong.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Square Enix and Macrospace managed to squeeze some nice graphics out of Aleste, but it's a pity that the rest of the game isn't as great as its visuals.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> All SuperPower 2 has going for it is an anything-can-happen atmosphere.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's easy to see how certain aspects of Metroid's design made it a classic, but 18 years later, the overall package just doesn't measure up to today's action adventure standards.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> ER's assembly-line approach to the process of saving lives and its utter lack of any meaningful or dramatic storytelling rob it of the two things the TV show is most ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> A year or two ago, this game's presentational frippery might have served to set it apart from the competition. In 2005, it's old hat.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Conflict: Desert Storm suffers from poor presentation and tedious gameplay.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This 2D fighter barely qualifies for minigame status.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The somewhat sloppy puzzle gameplay of Zzed pales in comparison to the game's clumsy, hand-hewn visuals and its English-as-a-second-language dialogue.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> A puzzle a day makes for little more than artificial value.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Unfortunately, none of Beatdown's interesting design ideas were executed well, leaving you with a game that feels half-baked and suffers from terrible pacing.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> This budget action game has its moments, but it's also a very shallow experience with very little depth or replayability.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> State of Emergency 2 replaces the first game's ultraviolent and fancy-free nature with a cavalcade of lame trial-and-error missions, and a lousy plot.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Even if you forgive the flimsy story and derivative gameplay, you'll have a hard time getting past the frustrating technical problems that plague this game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's got some occasionally interesting puzzles, but the lame story and irritating characters kill whatever appeal Keepsake might have had.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The injection of Pokémon characters and aspects hasn't done anything to improve ChunSoft's oft-copied dungeon hack.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Ford Street Racing plays best on the PSP, but it still isn't worth your time or money.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> In its day, the Genesis version of Altered Beast was a middling translation of a great arcade game. Now it scrapes by on decent action and some nostalgic value.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> The Xbox 360 has its share of poker titles, but none are as distinctly flawed as WCP: All In.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> History Channel: Civil War is good for a few mindless hours of shooting action, but not much else. History buffs need not apply.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Brutal difficulty makes Silent Heroes suitable solely for the squad-based real-time strategy experts.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> As the first poker game for the Wii, World Series of Poker is serviceable, though the lack of online play and lackluster presentation don't help its cause.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Loud, fast, and remarkably devoid of personality.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Bastard!! truly defines the term mish-mash.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Probably the most interesting thing about Sentient is that it does make you feel as if you're onboard a space station.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Streak is surprisingly rough around the edges for a third-generation racing game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's just sad that the best part of this campaign is what made the original one disappointing: its brevity.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Rush 2 attempts to embody the spirit of San Francisco Rush but fails to deliver as a sequel and a game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> At no point during the game do you feel compelled to play.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you have a lot of patience and like challenge in your games, you may get a lot of gameplay out of this title</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This is the way the Saturn ends, not with a bang but a whimper.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It'll definitely be in importers' bargain bins before too long.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The game plays just as it's supposed to; the problem is that the way it's supposed to play isn't particularly interesting or even very much fun.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> All Star Tennis 99's good-natured quirkiness is something of an afterthought to its middle-of-the-road gameplay.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> BuzzTime Trivia needs to become a more compelling game to be worth playing on the mobile platform.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Digimon World isn't for everyone - only dedicated Digimon fans or fans of the monster-raising genre need apply.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The average gamer just isn't going to find Towers' quest all that engaging or exciting.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> The reaction of the ball off the flippers and along the lanes is right on, but rebounds tend to occur at unlikely angles.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The developer clearly tried to make CSI accessible for a wide audience and in the process also removed all challenge from the game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Despite its interesting concept, Purge is difficult to recommend due to the lack of a large online population and some balance issues, bugs, and design quirks.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Conflict's problematic gameplay and run-of-the-mill presentation keep the game from succeeding on any level.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Thorgal's Quest is less of a quest and more of a short jaunt, since most players will be able to finish it in a single sitting.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Chaos Legion is essentially Devil May Cry with stripped-down combat mechanics, but to suggest that this game is comparable to Devil May Cry would be giving it too much credit.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> You'll almost certainly be unimpressed with the repetitive and cumbersome shooting action at the heart of this game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Drome Racers probably won't leave you with a very glowing opinion of futuristic racing games or the Lego brand.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The overly simplified gameplay really holds it back, and overall, it's a game that really can't be recommended to anyone, young or old.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you want a good rhythm game, look elsewhere. And if you want American Idol, just go watch the show.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Mysterious Journey II is filled with lots of arbitrary, convoluted, brutally tough puzzles. In fact, you could say this is really a puzzle game masquerading as an adventure game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Since there are literally hundreds of much better action games currently on the market, Cy Girls seems like a big waste of time.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Those who are new to the series may not get past Northland's dated graphics engine or game design, which hasn't evolved with the rest of the RTS genre.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While the emulation used to power these old games is well-done, the game is utterly lacking in the bells-and-whistles department.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Sergei Fedorov Face-Off Hockey is a mediocre title that has little to do with a real hockey experience, so it's unlikely to provide many with lasting enjoyment.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Monster Madness is a monster mess.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This game tests patience and logic, and Doom fans will find the only similarities here are the first-person perspective and the letter ""D"" in the name.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Created very much with its &amp;#145;80s ancestor in mind, the fantasy world of Dungeon Master II is complete, well-structured...and slooooww.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Wizardry Gold takes the classic story line from Wizardry VII and 
""enhances"" it with all new graphics, sounds, and interface.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Argos Gamesware's Ungaria doesn't really possess any of that nail-biting intensity that its puzzle-game ancestors had.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This bizarre new title pits alien against alien in a contest where the extra-terrestrial with the greatest understanding of frivolous earthling knowledge will win the right to call Earth home.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Unless you're a true Sonic fanatic, avoid this one.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Project: Horned Owl neither breaks into new territory nor  improves upon established standards.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This is a convincing simulation of pinball, but it falls short when compared to other video pinball games.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> When will the world tire of rail-shooters?</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> In the end, however, here is a perfect candidate for diminished stardom in thebargain bin.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> A single table just doesn't provide enough extended replay value to put it ahead of Hyper 3-D Pinball and other Saturn pinball games.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Die Hard Trilogy has been sabotaged - by shoddy graphics</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> SoulTrap's innovative gameplay, large levels, and seemingly endless variety show great potential.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Many people were surprised when the game hit store shelves on time, but it looks like it wasn't really ready to go.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The graphic effects are the only things that save Dark Rift from falling below average.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> You're more of an observer than active participant.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The games range from quite entertaining to downright stupid.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> All in all, FaceOff is simply average.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Sega Touring Car Championship is a mixed bag.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> This trail of new flying games may not be paved with gold.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's a far cry from the simple chore of helping a frog cross a busythoroughfare, but is it really more satisfying?</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Beast Wars is an imperfect but fun over-the-shoulder shooter.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> What is most frustrating about SkullMonkeys is that it just wears you down after a while.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> The only possible way I could recommend this game is if you're an avid Olympic hockey fan.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Unless you were a freak for the original game, you'll tire of RWT very quickly.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Revenge of Arcade's big problem is, surprisingly, the selection of games.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Overall, Bottom of the Ninth is a fair baseball title. But when it comes to sports games, fair isn't what you're looking for.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> A lot of the game's shortcomings, like its repetitive gameplay patterns, might not trouble the young ones nearly as much as the rest of us, for whom this one warrants ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> GT 64 is by no means a bad racing game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Vigilance succeeds only in making you wonder how good it could have been if it had been done right.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Whereas Hasbro's previous game tried to improve upon the board game, Surface Thunder has a very different approach: It's a simplistic 3D arcade shooter.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you're looking for something to play online, Maximum Pool does the job, albeit without any bells or whistles.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's hard to recommend a wrestling game that doesn't contain any actual in-the-ring wrestling.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It simply takes the weakest part of the original game and repackages it with a few ultimately inconsequential bonuses.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Aside from its amusing track design and decent customization elements, there really isn't anything much there in regard to actual compelling gameplay.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> I've never had this much trouble making a car go where I wanted it to.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It seems silly to malign a game about the undead by calling it lifeless, but that's exactly Shadow Man's problem.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Mortal Kombat Gold is sure to test even the biggest fan's faith in the line.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Bass Rise makes for an amusing diversion best suited for casual fishing fans who generally play for no longer than an hour per sitting.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> No Fear Downhill Mountain Biking tiptoes the line of being a good racing game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> NASCAR Challenge is a dull racing game that doesn't have much going for it.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> For snowmobile fans with a little extra cash to burn, Polaris SnoCross proves to be a rather entertaining diversion as long as you can accept its odd collision glitches.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> IMPORT: The game seems to have lost its focus and ends up somewhere between the ""free run"" Armored Core type of mech action game and the ""free floating"" Omega Boost ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you already own an Xbox, don't bother picking up the game, and if you're considering buying an Xbox, don't judge the console by this game.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While real-time strategy games have generally advanced far beyond 1995, Original War has actually regressed.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> ESPN NBA 2Night 2002 really has nothing that would make it worth recommending over a number of other basketball games for the PlayStation 2.</p>"

"<p class=""media-deck""> Pac-Man All-Stars simply isn't very fun.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Resident Evil Gaiden doesn't inspire the same level of interest that the other games in the franchise do.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Although no single aspect of this game is terrible, the overall package is unquestionably dull and limited.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Anyone looking for a ToeJam &amp; Earl fix would be better off digging up a copy of the original.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Its frustrating reliance on awkward platform jumping and its poor camera keep it from being recommendable to anyone at all.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Its frustrating reliance on awkward platform jumping and its poor camera keep it from being recommendable to anyone at all.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Silent Scope 3 is a decent adaptation of the arcade series, and offers a sometimes enjoyable but extremely brief experience.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Hopefully, Play the World's wretched online performance can be fixed in a patch.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Justice League: Injustice for All has nothing to differentiate it from the scores of other action adventure games on store shelves.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Resident Evil 2 on the GameCube may be enticing for those who have never played the game, and for them it might be worth a rental.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you've played any previous Bust-A-Move games, you've played Bust-A-Move 3000.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Regardless of whether you're looking for a turn-based strategy game or a role-playing game, Empire of Magic will probably disappoint you.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you've been waiting for a great rally racing game to come to the GameCube, keep waiting. Rally Championship isn't it.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Rugby 2004 is a decent re-creation of the sport, but it doesn't have the level of polish or any of the bells and whistles that have become standard in other ...</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Gotcha Force crutches itself far too heavily on brainless, clunky, and spastic action that doesn't so much entertain as it bewilders.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Operation Surma doesn't look good, and the gameplay is often awkward and frustrating.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Monster 4x4 offers a decent amount of different tracks and courses, but nothing that you do on any of these courses is the least bit interesting.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> While the GameCube isn't exactly long on off-road racing games, you can certainly find something better than Masters of Metal.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> If you do happen to get addicted to the combat, there's plenty of it to be found.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Unless you've already played every other game available in this genre, look elsewhere for your gratuitous action needs, as BlowOut doesn't deliver.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> It's unfortunate that the execution in the game is so disappointing in virtually every respect.</p>"
"<p class=""media-deck""> Unless you're absolutely rapt with morbid curiosity about how Malice ultimately turned out, your time and money are definitely best spent elsewhere.</p>"
